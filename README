My patches for fofix, you can read the details here :

And these patches are now updated for python3, tested with python 3.10,
pygame 2.1.2.
Requires the official cerealizer python module instead of the old
Cerealizer.py source file which was here
and the new but more primitive pyogg python module instead of the old ogg
and vorbis modules.
And that's all, newest python and newest pygame, and everything should be
ok. Tested on linux only.
